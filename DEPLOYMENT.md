# Production Deployment

This app is deployed to a Linux VPS managed through cPanel / WHM.

## Production Architecture

- Live domain: `https://quote.tamlite.co.uk`
- Root app directory: `/home/tamliteco/luxquote.app/`
- Runtime: Docker Compose using Laravel Sail containers
- Main app container: `laravel.test`
- Database container: `mysql`
- Database target: containerized MySQL, not cPanel MySQL
- External SSL/reverse proxy: cPanel host Apache terminates HTTPS and proxies traffic to the app container on local port `8080`

Because Apache terminates SSL before proxying to Docker, Laravel must trust proxy headers so generated URLs and redirects use the public HTTPS domain rather than `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Production should keep proxy trust configured in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$middleware->trustProxies(at: '*');
```

## Command Rules

Do not run bare PHP, Composer, Artisan, or npm commands directly on the host VPS. Run them through Docker Compose from:

```bash
cd /home/tamliteco/luxquote.app/
```

Common production commands:

```bash
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan optimize:clear
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan migrate --force
```

Use `--force` for production migrations to bypass Laravel's interactive production prompt.

## PDF Runtime

PDF generation uses Spatie Laravel PDF / Browsershot, which requires Node.js, Puppeteer, and a headless Chrome binary inside the `laravel.test` container.

Run npm and Puppeteer install/update commands as the `sail` user. Running them as root can create permission problems for the web process.

```bash
docker compose exec -u sail laravel.test npm install
docker compose exec -u sail laravel.test npx puppeteer browsers install chrome-headless-shell
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan optimize:clear
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan app:diagnose-pdf-environment
```

If PDFs fail in production, check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for Browsershot errors. A common failure is:

```text
Error: Cannot find module 'puppeteer'
```

That means the container cannot find the Node dependency required by Browsershot. Re-run the npm/Puppeteer commands above inside the `laravel.test` container.

## Database Restore Workflow

When restoring a raw SQL backup into the containerized MySQL service, use this exact sequence to avoid duplicate or stray table errors:

```bash
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan db:wipe
docker compose exec -T mysql mysql -u sail -ppassword laravel < backup.sql
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan migrate --force
```

## Deployment Method

Code is currently synced to the VPS via SFTP. After deploying code that changes PHP config, routes, views, migrations, dependencies, or frontend assets, run the relevant Docker Compose commands above.
